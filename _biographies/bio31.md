bio_text: "Daniel Seghers was a Flemish painter who worked mostly in Antwerp. After
  the death of his father, the silk merchant Pierre Seghers, Daniel and his mother
  moved to the northern Netherlands and took on the Calvinist faith. While he may
  have begun his training in the North, Seghers returned to Antwerp and Catholicism
  as a young man.\nSeghers became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1611,
  having trained under Jan Brueghel the Elder. He entered the Jesuit order in 1614.
  In 1625, Seghers became a Jesuit priest and began signing his works as Daniel Seghers
  Societatis Jesu. After his ordination, Seghers spent two years in Rome, but he moved
  back to Antwerp in 1627 and worked as a flower painter at a monastery until his
  death. \nFrom his teacher Jan Brueghel, Seghers took up the practice of garland
  painting, always a distinctly Flemish form. It became his specialty. His garlands
  encircled images by Antwerp colleagues like Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Cornelis
  Schut, and Gonzales Coques.\nSeghers’s flower pictures are considered part of the
  Jesuit Order’s Counter-Reformation campaign. He and his collaborators emphasized
  the devotional characters of the main images, and the theologians of his Order believed
  Segher’s garlands aided worship of the figures they surrounded."
