comment: '<p>According to Louisa Wood Ruby, this later painting includes Castel dellâ€™Ovo,
  which seems to have been one of Jan Brueghel (I)''s preferred motifs, showing up
  in two of his drawings. His <a href="/object/view-of-the-castel-dellovo">View of
  the Castel dell''Ovo</a> with its companion in the same collection <a href="/object/view-of-naples-harbor">Harbor
  of Naples</a> has historically been considered evidence of Jan Brueghel (I)''s activity
  in Naples.  His earliest paintings, <a href="/object/christ-in-the-storm-christ-and-apostles-on-the-lake-of-tiberius-milan">Christ
  in the Storm (Christ and Apostles on the Lake of Tiberius) (Milan)</a> and this
  painting of the same subject in the collection Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid of 1596,
  as well as two magnificent later paintings in Munich, <a href="/object/the-continence-of-scipio">The
  Continence of Scipio</a> of ca. 1603 and the <a href="/object/large-fish-market-with-self-portrait">Large
  Fish Market with Self Portrait</a> of 1603."</p>
