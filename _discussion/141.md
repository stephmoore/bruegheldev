comment: "<p>There are numerous other drawings of this same site by other Northern
  artists: Willem van Nieulandt, Sebastiaen Vrancx, Tobias Verhaecht. Ruby suggests
  that they were all working from, or inspired by, a lost drawing by Matthijs Bril.
  See Ruby in Munich 2013, p. 41 and note 25.</p>\n"
