comment: "<p>Subject of this painting is actually a village kermis, which can be seen
  in the background, including a procession to the church. The dancing couples in
  the foreground are completely not derived from the Pieter Bruegel compositions he
  had been using up until then but I wonder if they are from German prints.</p>\n"
