comment: "<p>The accumulation of a carts and boats marks parallel trajectories into
  pictorial space converging on the windmill; the cross of its sails mirroring the
  crossed masts of the fishing boats. The topic of the painting becomes interwoven
  within these compositional trajectories as traffic along roads and waterways acts
  as a dominant force on everyday life in rural Brabant.</p>\n"
