comment: "<p>Ertz suggested that this work, a tempera/watercolor on paper, could have
  been a study for Jan's part of the painting after Rubens showed him what he was
  going to do. But the two had been working together for a decade without such props,
  which would in any event be completely uncharacteristic for Jan. Without further
  examination of the actual object, I can only suggest that this very odd work is
  a later copy after the Paris painting.</p>\n"
