  <p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue or in the Honig Database.</p>
  <p>The paint was applied with extremely fine brushes and tiny impasto. Many of the finer details of the design elements were painted over the underlying tone rather than in a space left in reserve. Particularly, the painting and its support are in good condition, with only minor abrasion. </p>
  <p>The painting recently underwent conservation and preservation treatment in 2000.</p>
