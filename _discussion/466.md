  <p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue nor the Honig Database.</p>
  <p>There is the mark of Pieter Stas on the back of the copper panel as well as the hand of Antwerp.</p>
  <p>The character of this scene is reminiscent of the river Scheldt as it passes though the Flemish countryside on its gradual course toward Antwerp and the North Sea. The large Church dominating the horizon in the distance is recognizable as the Antwerp Cathedral.</p>
