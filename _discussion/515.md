comment: '<p>British Museum website: "This small fragment is probably cut from a larger
  sheet (<a href="/object/sheet-of-studies-of-figures-and-carts">Sheet of Studies
  of Figures and Carts</a>), for comment see also SL,5236.56." These other possible
  fragments are <a href="/object/small-study-of-three-figures">Small Study of Three
  Figures</a> and <a href="/object/small-study-of-a-man-to-right-with-a-fishing-rod">Small
