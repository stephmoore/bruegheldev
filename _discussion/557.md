  <p><a href="/object/the-harvest-allegory-of-summer">The Harvest: Allegory of Summer</a> is part of a four-part series of the allegories of the seasons which Jan Brueghel painted circa 1594 (Ertz 2008-10).</p>

  <p>Ertz 2008-10 links Brueghel's <a href="/object/the-harvest-allegory-of-summer">The Harvest: Allegory of Summer</a> to Pieter Brueghel the Elder's "Wheat Harvest" in New York.</p>
  <p>There are no copies or variants of this work, typical of his oddly-shaped works.</p>
