comment: "<p>Although Winner had accepted this & related drawings in Rotterdam as
  being by Jan, Ruby believes that they are copies made in Rome after his (now lost)
  originals. Other copies inscribed with the same handwriting are now in the Ecole
  des Beaux Arts, Paris. Jan had probably brought with him to Rome a sketchbook of
  motifs that he had drawn while in Naples. He would use those motifs frequently in
  his paintings. The subject of this drawing, the Castel dâ€™Ovo, appears in early works
  in Milan and Madrid, as well as in later paintings in Munich</p>\n"
