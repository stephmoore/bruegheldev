comment: "<p>Ertz has argued that not only the landscape but also the horses in the
  battle might be by Jan. Even though Jan was more engaged with battle painting at
  a moment shortly after this, the horses don't look like his type, and in terms of
  technical execution it would hardly be possible.</p>\n"
