general_notes: Carl van Mander mentions it in 1604 as forming part of the collection
  of German emperor, Rudolph II at Prague. It is probably to this picture that reference
  is made in a manuscript preserved at Skokloster Castle in Sweden, where mound the
  works to be found at the royal palace at Prague in 1647-48 is mentioned "A picture
  representing a fire, in which a female fury is seen surrounded by various monsters".
  The picture, in due course, passed from Prague into private collection in Sweden.
  In the nineteenth century it was in the Brogten Collection| thence it reached the
  Christian Hammer Collection in Stockholm where it hung with other works taken from
  Prague in the sack of the city.
