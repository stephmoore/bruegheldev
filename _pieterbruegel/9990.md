general_notes: Possible provenance from Micheal Auner that painting was in Hungary
  from 1569-70 as part of private collection of Hungarian Batthyányi family. Another
  possible provenance is that painting is part of Infante Isabella's collection, mentioned
  in the inventory of Coudenberg palace in Brussels as "predicatie van St Jan"; however,
  there is a discrepancy in the size of the canvas. Mentioned by Antwerp art collector
  Peeter Stevens in the margins of his copy of Van Mander's Schilder-Boeck, between
  1625 and 1668.
