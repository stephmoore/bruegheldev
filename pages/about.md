The purpose of this website is to serve as a place where information about the artists Pieter Bruegel and his son Jan Brueghel can be gathered, shared, and debated among scholars. It is meant to provide ways of furthering our understanding of how the Brueg(h)el family produced a complex body of interconnected work. The site also serves as a general resource for any visitor who is interested in the artists' works. Visitors are encouraged to explore between the two catalogs to investigate the relationship between the Brueg(h)els and their works.
